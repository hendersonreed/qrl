# qrl: curl a qr code

I was frustrated by the huge number of bad QR code generators that are available on the internet. So I made my own.

It supports:

- only 1 size (256x256)
- no colors besides black and white
- no web browsers, you need to `curl` it (if you navigate to it via web browser, it gives you instructions on how to `curl it`.

## feature roadmap:

- maybe support colors with query parameters?
- add an easily clickable `copy` button on the example text
- make the site more responsive.
